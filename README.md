# TileBoard Simulation

This was my **first large-scale Java project**, built for my Large Programs class at the University of New Mexico. It served as a crash course in managing complexity, threading, and GUI logic — and while the code is a little funky in places (early-project charm), it reflects my growth as a developer.

The project centers around a tile-based board system with interactive display logic and a main game loop architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- Java-based tile board simulation
- Board, Tile, and Display logic managed across separate classes
- Game loop structure with interactive updates
- Java Swing GUI elements

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Board.java`: Handles board generation and layout
- `Tiles.java`: Defines individual tile behavior and properties
- `Display.java`: Manages visual rendering and updates
- `MainGameLoop.java`: Core simulation loop driving updates

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure a multi-class Java project
- Working with GUI rendering in Java
- Managing update loops and user interactions
- Debugging complexity (a.k.a. my best frenemy)

---

## ☕ Notes

This project is unpolished but meaningful — a snapshot of my early growth as a programmer. It laid the groundwork for cleaner code and stronger designs in my later projects.

---

## 🔧 Future Ideas

- Refactor logic to reduce coupling
- Add user controls for tile interaction
- Modularize rendering and game loop management

---

## 📚 Technologies

- Java 17
- Swing (Java GUI)
